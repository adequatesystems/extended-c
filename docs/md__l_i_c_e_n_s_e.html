Plain English Preface</h1>
<p >In plain English, this license agreement is a modified version of the MPL 2.0 license under which Adequate Systems provides an "open source" version of the software that underpins the Mochimo cryptocurrency network. This license is intended to convey to you the right to modify the source code of the Mochimo Cryptocurrency Engine in order to make improvements to the performance or behavior of the Mochimo cryptocurrency network, or improvements to the tools, wallets and other supporting software that work with the Mochimo cryptocurrency. No other use or modification of the code is permitted. Within this narrow field of use, the community may do with the software as it sees fit and without oversight or approval by Adequate Systems. However, please understand that the below license does not allow you to create new cryptocurrencies with our software, nor does it allow you to use or modify any of Adequate Systems' software in order to make it compatible with any other cryptocurrency projects. Finally, this license contains a mandatory grant back to Adequate Systems to any modifications or improvements you might make. Please consider that carefully before contributing your work to the Mochimo project.</p>

<ul>
<li>**(a)** the Original Software in Source Code Form or</li>
<li>**(b)** Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Forms of the Original Software and the Covered Software are governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Forms.</li>
</ul>
<p >3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
<ul>
<li>**(a)** If You distribute the Original Software in Executable Form then:<ul>
<li>**(i)** You must also make the Original Software available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</li>
<li>**(ii)** You may distribute such Executable Form of the Original Software under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms; provided that, if You sublicense the Executable Form of the Original Software under different terms:<ul>
<li>**(1)** You hereby grant to Adequate Systems a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, freely assignable, and fully sublicensable (including through multiple tiers of sublicensing) license:<ul>
<li><b>a.</b> under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by You to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, an otherwise exploit any Modifications You have made to the Original Software or any work You combine with the Original Software to create a Larger Work (as provided in Section 3.3); and</li>
<li><b>b.</b> under Your Patent Claims to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer any Modifications You have made to the Original Software or any work You combine with the Original Software to create a Larger Work (as provided in Section 3.3).</li>

<li>**(2)** the license for the Executable Form must include as an express condition of the license a restriction that the Original Software is licensed strictly for use in the Field, and for no other fields of use;</li>
<li>**(3)** if the license for the Executable Form permits licensees to create Modifications of or Larger Works with the Original Software, such license must include as an express condition of the license the same grant-back of rights to Adequate Systems in such Modifications and Larger Works as You are required to grant to Adequate Systems under Section 3.2(a)(ii)(1); and</li>
<li>**(4)** the license for the Executable Form shall not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<ul>
<li>**(b)** If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h2>
<p >You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software and the Original Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at the recipient’s option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s); provided, however, the Original Software must always be distributed as provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
3.4. Notices</h2>
<p >You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software or Original Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h2>
<p >You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software or Original Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor and Adequate Systems for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h1>
<p >If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software or Original Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You may not use the Covered Software or Original Software for any purpose.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
5. Termination</h1>
<p ><b>5.1.</b> The rights granted by Adequate Systems and by any and all Contributors to You under this License will terminate automatically and immediately if You fail to comply with any of its terms.</p>
<p ><b>5.2.</b> If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that the Original Software or a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by Adequate Systems for the Original Software and any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this License shall terminate immediately.</p>
<p ><b>5.3.</b> In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall also terminate.</p>
<p ><b>5.4.</b> Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this License shall survive termination of this License for any reason.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h1>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p >&zwj;Original Software and Covered Software are provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Original Software or Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Original Software and Covered Software is with You. Should any Original Software or Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not Adeqaute Systems, nor any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Original Software or Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
7. Limitation of Liability</h1>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p >&zwj;Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall Adequate Systems nor any Contributor, nor anyone who distributes Original Software or Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
8. Choice of Law and Litigation</h1>
<p >This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, USA, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License in which Adequate Systems is named as a party must be brought in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida or a state court in Hillsborough County, Florida. Any litigation relating to this License in which Adequate Systems is not a party may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
9. Miscellaneous</h1>
<p >This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. Adequate Systems may freely transfer or assign this License, in whole or in part, including an assignment of any or all rights or a delegation of any or all duties, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide public notice of any such transfer, assignment or delegation. You may not sublicense any rights granted to You under this License except as provided in this License and You may not transfer or assign this License, in whole or in part, including any assignment of any rights or delegation of any duties, except with the prior written consent of Adequate Systems and each applicable Contributor. Any purported transfer, assignment or delegation that does not comply with this paragraph shall be void at its inception.</p>

10.2. Effect of New Versions</h2>
