/**
 * @file extthread.h
 * @brief Extended thread and mutex support.
 * @details The support functions in this file are based on
 * POSIX Threads. Functionality is extended to Windows systems by
 * wrapping Windows API routines in functions imitating, as much
 * as reasonably possible, associated "pthreads" counterparts.
 * <br/>Thread function syntax: @code
 * ThreadProc threadfn(void *args)
 * {
 *    // ... thread routine ...
 *    Unthread;  // ends the thread
 * }
 * ThreadId startThread(ThreadRoutine func, void *args)
 * {
 *    ThreadId tid;
 *    thread_create(&tid, func, args);
 *    return tid;
 * }
 * int main()
 * {
 *    ThreadId tid = startThread(threadfn, NULL);
 * } @endcode
 * @copyright Adequate Systems LLC, 2021-2022. All Rights Reserved.
 * <br />For license information, please refer to ../LICENSE.md
 * @note For use in UNIX-style operating systems, POSIX Threads
 * must be linked by the compiler using the `-pthread` option.
